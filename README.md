# Credit-Risk-Modeling <br>

### Introduction
The purpose of this project is to find the best model to predict whether a person will fail to repay their loan according to the terms agreed to in the promissory note. <br>
<br>
The data for this project are public dataset from kaggle and can be downloaded here: <br>

## Models
The models used for this project are:
- RandomForest Classifier
- CatBoost Classifier
- RegLog Regression

This project also tried to use __IterativeImputer__ to handle missing value.

### Results
The best model to predict this model is __CatBoost Classifier__ with __93,7% accurancy__.
